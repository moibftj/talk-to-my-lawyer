# Product Roadmap

This roadmap is a living plan for upcoming work across the platform. Timelines are directional and may shift based on regulatory or customer needs.

## Near-term (next 1–2 quarters)
- **Admin review improvements**: streamline queue triage, add bulk actions, and tighten audit trails for reviewer edits to speed approvals and reduce manual friction.
- **Email reliability hardening**: improve queue visibility, add delivery diagnostics, and tighten retry/backoff behavior for critical notifications.
- **Letter workflow polish**: refine draft/save/resubmit flows, add clearer status labels, and reduce double submissions in the subscriber dashboard.
- **Operational guardrails**: strengthen rate-limit messaging, add clearer error states, and standardize telemetry around AI generation failures.

## Mid-term (next 2–4 quarters)
- **Analytics extensions**: expand admin analytics with cohort tracking, letter volume trends, and approval cycle time breakdowns.
- **Subscription lifecycle tooling**: add proactive renewal notices, coupon usage insights, and self-serve billing history filters.
- **Attorney portal enhancements**: richer editing tools, templated snippets, and configurable review checklists.
- **Compliance workflow support**: deeper audit exports, stronger data access logging, and improved GDPR request handling.

## Long-term (12+ months)
- **Multi-tenant readiness**: isolate data, branding, and billing per partner organization.
- **Advanced automation**: smart reviewer assignment, SLA-aware queues, and predictive approval time estimates.
- **Internationalization**: localized templates, regional compliance options, and multi-currency billing.
- **Ecosystem integrations**: secure API partnerships for document storage, e-signature, and CRM sync.
